**ES6 Basics**

Welcome to the world of ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, a major update to the JavaScript language that brought numerous enhancements and new features. This README will provide you with a quick summary of some essential concepts in ES6.

### What is ES6?

ES6, short for ECMAScript 6, is a significant update to the JavaScript language standardized by ECMA International. It was released in 2015 and brought many improvements and new features to JavaScript, enhancing its readability, maintainability, and functionality.

### New Features Introduced in ES6

- **Constants (`const`) and Variables (`let`):** Introduced new variable declaration keywords that provide block-scoped variables, unlike `var`.
- **Arrow Functions:** A concise syntax for writing functions, especially useful for callbacks and function expressions.
- **Template Literals:** Allow for easier string interpolation and multiline strings using backticks (\`) and `${}` syntax.
- **Rest and Spread Operators:** Introduced `...` syntax for handling variable numbers of arguments in functions and spreading iterable objects.
- **Object Destructuring:** Simplifies the extraction of data from arrays and objects using syntax like `{ prop1, prop2 } = object`.
- **Iterators and for-of Loops:** Introduced iterable and iterator protocols, along with the `for...of` loop for easy iteration over iterable objects.
- **Enhanced Object Literals:** Allow for shorthand property definitions, computed property names, and methods definition in object literals.

### Difference Between a Constant and a Variable

- **Constants (`const`):** Declared using the `const` keyword, their value cannot be reassigned after initialization, but their properties can be modified if they are objects or arrays.
- **Variables (`let`):** Declared using the `let` keyword, their value can be reassigned, making them mutable.

### Block-Scoped Variables

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block ({}) where they are declared.

### Arrow Functions and Function Parameters Default to Them

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions. They inherit the `this` value from the surrounding code and do not have their own `this`. They are often used as anonymous functions or for concise callbacks.

### Rest and Spread Function Parameters

Rest parameters (`...`) allow a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. Spread syntax (`...`) is used to expand elements of an iterable (like an array) into individual elements.

### String Templating in ES6

Template literals allow for easier string interpolation and multiline strings using backticks (\`) and `${}` syntax. They provide a cleaner and more readable way to create strings compared to traditional concatenation.

### Object Creation and Their Properties in ES6

ES6 introduced enhanced object literals, allowing for shorthand property definitions, computed property names, and method definitions in object literals. This makes object creation and manipulation more intuitive and concise.

### Iterators and for-of Loops

ES6 introduced the concept of iterators and the `for...of` loop, making it easier to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, and sets. The `for...of` loop simplifies iteration, while iterators allow for custom iteration behavior.
